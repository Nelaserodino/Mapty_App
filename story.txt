Step 2 - Features.

1. 
I will need a map where user clicks to add a new workout (best way to get location coordinates).

I will need to use geolocation to display a map at current location (more user friendly).

I will need a form to input distance, time, pace, steps/minute.

2. I will need a form to input distance, time, speed, elevation gain.

3. I will need to display all workouts in a list.

4. I will need to display all workouts on the map.

5. 
I will need to store workout data in the browser using a local storage API.
On page load, read the saved data from local storage and display it.

Step 3 - Flowchart

When the page loads, first I need to get the current location coordinates and  then render a map on current location.

When the user clicks on a certain position on the map, a workout form will be rendered.

When the user submits the form, it will be rendered on the map and in the list. It will also be stored in te local storage, so that it can be loaded whenever the page loads.

When the user clicks on a workout in the list, the map moves to show the location of that workout.
